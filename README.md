# Retro Mega Next (JD637 Fork)
A fork of the great Retro Mega Next theme (see original README below) with a few minor customizations...

- Collection images are now full-screen background images (PSD template included)
- Re-ordered collections so "All Games", "Favorites", etc is at the end of the list after the collections

That's it for now! Note that only a few collections have the new background images, so any others won't look right. But you can make your own background images with the included PSD template (edit with Photoshop or the free alternative, Photopea.com).

# Retro Mega Next
[Pegasus](https://pegasus-frontend.org) theme for handheld devices.

Adapted from [David Fumberger's RetroMega](https://github.com/djfumberger/retromega) theme. Completely rewritten from scratch to simplify code and allow me to add new features easier. I looked at each line of code, asking myself "what does it do?", "is it needed?", and "can it be done better?"

## Installation and Scraping
[Download](https://github.com/plaidman/retromega-next/releases) and extract to your [theme directory](http://pegasus-frontend.org/docs/user-guide/installing-themes) under the folder retromega. You can then select the theme in the settings menu of Pegasus.

The theme uses `boxart2dfront` on the games list, `screenshot` in the game detail view, and `video` in both areas.

To setup Pegasus with scraped assets, there's a great written guide [available here](https://basvroegop.nl/pegasus) or a great video guide [available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGWve7YYwGQ). You can also use [DragoonDorise's pegasus installer](https://www.pegasus-installer.com/) to scrape files on your device easier.
